# Bug Fix: Map Click Not Triggering Right Panel Display

## Issue
When clicking a country on the map, the selection was captured but the right panel still showed "Click a country" message instead of displaying the country's details. The dropdown showed the correct country, but the details didn't appear automatically.

## Root Cause
The right panel logic was checking the `selected_country` variable from the dropdown instead of the `st.session_state.selected_country` that gets set when clicking the map.

**Problematic Code:**
```python
# This only checked the dropdown variable
if selected_country and selected_country != 'Select a country...':
    # Display details
```

## Solution
Introduced a `display_country` variable that:
1. **Prioritizes session state** (from map clicks)
2. **Falls back to dropdown** (for manual selection)
3. **Syncs both methods** seamlessly

**Fixed Code:**
```python
# Determine which country to display
display_country = None

# Check session state first (from map click)
if st.session_state.selected_country and st.session_state.selected_country in filtered_df['Country'].values:
    display_country = st.session_state.selected_country
    # Sync dropdown to show this country
    default_index = sorted(filtered_df['Country'].unique().tolist()).index(st.session_state.selected_country) + 1
else:
    default_index = 0

# Dropdown for manual selection
dropdown_selection = st.selectbox("Or select manually:", country_list, index=default_index)

# Update if manually selected
if dropdown_selection != 'Select a country...':
    display_country = dropdown_selection
    st.session_state.selected_country = dropdown_selection

# Display details if we have any selection
if display_country:
    country_data = get_country_info(map_df, display_country)
    # ... show details
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Click on Map
```
1. User clicks "Switzerland" on map
2. st.session_state.selected_country = "Switzerland"
3. App reruns
4. display_country = "Switzerland" (from session state)
5. Dropdown auto-selects "Switzerland" (synced)
6. Right panel shows Switzerland's details immediately ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Use Dropdown
```
1. User selects "Norway" from dropdown
2. dropdown_selection = "Norway"
3. display_country = "Norway"
4. st.session_state.selected_country = "Norway" (synced)
5. Right panel shows Norway's details ✅
6. Map highlights Norway ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Click Multiple Countries
```
1. User clicks "Brazil" → Details show
2. User clicks "Japan" → Details update to Japan
3. User clicks "Kenya" → Details update to Kenya
All seamless! ✅
```

## Before vs After

### Before (Broken)
```
User clicks map → Session state updated → App reruns
→ Dropdown shows clicked country BUT
→ Right panel still shows "Click a country" ❌
→ User confused
```

### After (Fixed)
```
User clicks map → Session state updated → App reruns
→ Dropdown shows clicked country AND
→ Right panel immediately shows details ✅
→ Smooth experience!
```

## Testing

✅ **Test 1**: Click country on map
- Expected: Details appear immediately
- Result: ✅ PASS

✅ **Test 2**: Select country from dropdown
- Expected: Details appear, session state updates
- Result: ✅ PASS

✅ **Test 3**: Click map, then use dropdown
- Expected: Both stay synced
- Result: ✅ PASS

✅ **Test 4**: Apply filters with country selected
- Expected: If country still visible, keep selection; otherwise reset
- Result: ✅ PASS

✅ **Test 5**: Change year range with country selected
- Expected: Details update with new year data
- Result: ✅ PASS

## Files Modified
- `app.py` (lines 413-441): Fixed selection logic in right panel

## Impact
- **User Experience**: Dramatically improved - clicks now work as expected
- **Code Quality**: Better separation of concerns (session state vs UI state)
- **Maintainability**: Clearer logic flow with `display_country` variable

## Lessons Learned
When implementing click-to-select:
1. Always distinguish between **UI state** (dropdown) and **application state** (session)
2. Create a clear **single source of truth** for display logic
3. Sync UI components **reactively** based on application state
4. Test the **full interaction flow**, not just individual pieces
